e0 = '''INTRODUCTION
This is a solo adventure for the Call of Cthulhu game. It is a
horror story set in the 1920s where you are the main character,
and your choices determine the outcome. It is also designed to
lead you through the basic rules of the game in a gradual and
entertaining fashion. Although most such adventures are played
with your friends, this one is just for you.
Before you begin to play, make sure you have a copy of the
Call of Cthulhu Seventh Edition Quick-Start Rules, and a blank
investigator sheet. You can download a printable investigator
sheet, or an interactive PDF version of the sheet, as well as the
Quick-Start Rules from www.chaosium.com. You’ll also need
a pencil, an eraser, and some roleplaying dice.
You don’t need to read the rules before you start playing. Just
settle in a comfortable chair before a roaring fire. Then read on
and follow the instructions.
...On second thoughts, don’t sit too close to the fire.

e1 = '''Your adventure begins...
The sun is high in the sky, a merciless ball of heat. You feel
scorched by the time you reach the bus halt in front of Osborn’s
Drug Store. It’s a relief to put down your heavy cases and take
off your hat for a moment. You fan your face. It has been a long
summer here, in your hometown, and yet a curiously empty one.
You look across the street, at the grubby butcher’s shop, the
grocers with its faded awning, and the shabby tobacconist.
Mistrustful faces glare at you as they pass, eyeing your clothes
and luggage. It was your parents’ choice to live here, not yours.
You were happy down south as a child, among Providence’s
white-walled houses and leafy churchyards. Perhaps this new
job in Arkham will supply the change you need.
Yet everybody you know in the world lives here. You know
nobody in Arkham, not one soul. You ask yourself one last time
if you are doing the right thing.
The answer is here. None of your supposed friends have come
to see you off. You are alone. Whatever challenges lie in Arkham,
it will be a new life, and a brave one.
A small gray motor coach approaches and rattles to a stop.
You put your hat back on and pick up your cases.
'''

e2 = '''You put up a spirited resistance, but the man’s bulk and
determination wear you down. Finally he lands a crushing blow
and you drop. Blackness floods in.
Later, you are dimly aware of your legs being lifted and your
back scraping against the ground as you are dragged off.
'''

e3 = '''Your morning exertions have left you hungry. You roam the 
streets of Emberhead looking for sustenance. There is nothing 
resembling the busy cafés of your hometown, or anything that 
might be called a restaurant.
It is beginning to look like you will have to get supplies from 
the general store when May Ledbetter comes down the street 
with a girl trailing in her wake. This must be Ruth. As she notices 
you, she races past her mother and approaches you with a smile. 
This is a different Ruth from the shy creature of last night.
As she reaches you, she stops and stretches her arms up in 
celebration. She looks up into your eyes. Abruptly the smile drops 
from her face and she looks several years older.
“Get out before the festival,” she hisses. “Get out!” She blinks 
hard, then scuttles back towards her mother.
May approaches, wrapping an arm around her daughter’s 
shoulders. She smiles. “How are you getting on? Have you found 
transport?”
Startled, you explain the frustrations of the situation.
“I’d try Mr. Winters in the village hall. He’s always in of an 
afternoon. You’ll be hungry by now? Help yourself to any food 
in the house. The door’s not locked.”
You glance at Ruth where she has squirreled herself behind 
her mother’s leg. Her eyes implore you to silence.

back of the motor coach. The rack is set inconveniently high on 
the vehicle. You get a grip on the heavier case.
'''

e9 = '''You crouch down and ask Ruth what she meant.
“It’s scary at the festival,” Ruth says. “It’s bright and hot and 
the flames go all over!” Her face and voice are both childlike. 
This abrupt shift is disturbing. You suppose all children do 
unfathomable things.
May rolls her eyes and tousles her daughter’s hair. Ruth looks 
at the ground.

tired avenues of your old home slip behind you, receding into 
the distance. For a few minutes, you can still see the church spire 
over the brow of a low hill. Then the road dips and it, too, is gone.
Arkham is your new home. You will travel there, and make 
a new start.

One looks you up and down before heading away. The driver also
steps down, glancing at you before crossing the road to visit the
tobacconist. When he returns, he is rolling a cigarette between
his yellowed fingers. He gives it a final twist and examines you
as he reaches for his matchbox. He is a thin man in his fifties,
dressed in a stained shirt with the bus company emblem. Yet his
eyes are sharp in their dark sockets.
“Where to?”
You show him your ticket for Ossipee. From there you will
connect to Rochester and Portsmouth, before the coastal line to
Newburyport and, finally, Arkham. 
You should be able to afford a rail ticket for at least some of the way; 
otherwise this will be the first of many long bus trips.
“Mmm-hm.” The driver scratches the match and lights his
cigarette. The end flares as he takes a draw. Then he exhales and
gestures to the back of the coach. “Luggage rack’s up there.

people around the Beacon freeze, their black painted faces 
bleached and stripped, as a second sun opens in the air above 
Emberhead. In an instant, the people, the village, the hill, all 
are consumed; incinerated by impossible proximity to sheer 
combustion, the essence of fire.
Though your body is bound to the Beacon, your being is freed. 
As a spark you race into space, catapulted through the vastness of 
the void. The stars burn past you with incomprehensible velocity. 
And then you are home.
Forever you will dwell here, at Fomalhaut; where the flames 
ripple and flow through immense spaces to the rhythms of 
the universe; where planets themselves move and tilt through 
unutterable wheels of fire, bound to the clockwork chaos of the 
Living Flame.
And among the flames you will dance.
